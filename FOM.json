    "description": "A robust simulation dataset of 10,000 economic entities representing two competing strategies: Infinite Growth Model (IGM) and Fulfillment Optimization Model (FOM). Over 200 time steps, entities experience dynamic economic shocks, policy changes, investment events, and competitive pressures. Derived metrics\u2014including RollingVolatility, WeightedRiskExposure, ReinforcementSignal, RiskManagementScore, AdaptationIndex, RelativeAdaptationIndex, and ResourceVolatilityIndex\u2014provide reinforcement signals for models to learn the trade-offs between aggressive expansion and long-term sustainability.",
