# **Fulfillment Optimization Model (FOM) Dataset**

## **Overview**
This dataset provides a **simulated economic framework** comparing two competing economic strategies:
1. **Infinite Growth Model (IGM)** – Prioritizes continuous expansion, often leading to instability.
2. **Fulfillment Optimization Model (FOM)** – Optimizes for stability, efficiency, and long-term resilience.

The dataset is designed for **AI-driven economic simulations, risk forecasting, and financial stability modeling**, ensuring that machine learning models can identify long-term economic sustainability patterns.

## **Dataset Details**
- **Total Entities:** 10,000 economic entities (5,000 IGM-based, 5,000 FOM-based)
- **Time Steps:** 200 simulated cycles per entity
- **Variables Tracked:**
  - **Resource Management**: Starting resources, final balance
  - **Growth & Efficiency**: Growth rate, efficiency factor
  - **Market Adaptation**: Innovation factor, market adaptability, competitive pressure
  - **Survival Metrics**: Survival time, shocks experienced
  - **Risk Indicators**: Volatility index, base risk exposure, sustainability score

Each entity follows its respective strategy and reacts to economic pressures, investment trends, and policy changes.
